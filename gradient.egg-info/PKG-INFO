## Setting Up an S3 Bucket on AWS

Before running a miner or validator, you need to set up an S3 bucket on AWS and configure your environment to use AWS credentials. Follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Create an AWS Account
If you don't already have an AWS account, go to the AWS homepage and sign up.

### Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2. Click **Create bucket**.
3. Provide a unique name for your bucket and select the AWS Region where you want the bucket to reside.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure options and set permissions. For most use cases, the default settings will suffice.
5. Click **Create bucket** to finalize.

### Step 3: Obtain AWS Access Credentials
1. Navigate to the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**, then **Add user**.
3. Enter a user name, select **Programmatic access** for the AWS access type, and click **Next: Permissions**.
4. Choose **Attach existing policies directly** and select the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy.
5. Follow the rest of the on-screen instructions to create the user. After the user is created, you'll be provided with an **Access key ID** and a **Secret access key**. Make a note of these credentials.

### Step 4: Configure Your Environment
Open a terminal and run the following commands to add your AWS credentials to your `~/.bash_profile`. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the credentials obtained in the previous step.
```bash
echo "export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKIA3TN4TF2QQ4KC4CBA'" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='a/VLFo0RIlS6WSn2BoLffsRW1frmwm5AyoFcQj2e'" >> ~/.bash_profile
`
